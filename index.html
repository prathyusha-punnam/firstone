   <h3><font color="red">What is CSS?</font></h3> 
   <ol type="1">
   <li> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
   <br>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strike>Css is not neccesary</strike><b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
    <br>
    <li><u><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></u></li>
   </ol>
   <h3> <font color="red">CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways: </font></h3>
   <ul>
       <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
       <li>internal-by using a style element in the head section</li>
       <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
       <li> The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
       </ul>  
       <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and itâ€™s used by JavaScript. </p>
       <p>in CSS,selectors are used to target aspecific element on a webpage.once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
       <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. </p>
